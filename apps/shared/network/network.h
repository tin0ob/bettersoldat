// The wire: what the client and the server say to each other, and how it is laid out
// (docs/netcode.md). Transport is ENet, one unreliable channel and one reliable; this
// is the bytes.
//
// One serializer serves both directions. A NetBuf is writing or reading, and every
// net_* call writes the value it is given or reads into it, so a message has one
// routine that reads and writes it and cannot disagree with itself. Reading refuses
// what it cannot trust: bits past the end, a float that is not a number, a value past
// its range, a string too long. The buffer goes bad and stays bad, and the caller
// drops the message whole (netbuf_ok). Writing a value that does not fit its width
// goes bad the same way, so a width chosen too small is found in a test, not on the
// wire.
//
// Netfields lay a struct on the wire. A table, one entry per field with its offset,
// size, kind and width, drives one routine (netfields_serialize) that writes the struct
// whole or as a delta against a baseline (one bit per field, then the fields that
// changed) and reads it back, unchanged fields taken from the baseline. The soldier's
// halves have their tables here, held to soldier_copy_owned and soldier_copy_served by
// a test.
//
// Integers are little-endian in memory on both ends, as x86 and ARM are; the wire is
// bits in emission order, so it does not care.
