// What happens to the entities: the systems, one file each, run as the passes of a
// tick in the order world_step gives them (game.h). Each takes the static Context and
// the World it acts on; nothing here keeps state of its own.
//
// The systems talk only through events. A pass writes its own entities and reads any;
// what it wants of another's it emits, and the owner's pass does it when it runs: a
// shot (EVENT_SHOT) becomes a bullet in the bullet pass, a gun let go of
// (EVENT_WEAPON_DROP) is laid down by the things pass, a kit's gift (EVENT_KIT_PICKUP)
// is taken by the soldier in the receipts pass. A pass consumes every event since it
// last ran (events_pending): this tick's before it began, and the last tick's after it
// ran, so what a later pass asks of an earlier one happens next tick, as in the
// original's frame. The same events are what the client shows and what the wire
// carries; a shot heard from another machine is a shot like any other.
//
// Some of a soldier's fields are another system's on it, written by that system's pass
// alone: what it holds and mans and the heat it has run up (held, stat, use_time) and
// the things' counters on it (flag_grab_cooldown, medikit_cooldown) are the things';
// its health, its death and its tally are the wounds'.
