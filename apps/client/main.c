// The client. Reads as what it is: each subsystem opened, the loop, each closed.
//
//   console the cvars, the commands and the binds (shared/console), run first: the
//           default binds, then the config (config/), then the command line
//   game    the world (shared/game), for now ticked here with authority: a local
//           sandbox with one soldier, until the connection to a server is ported
//   input   the keys and mouse, through the binds (input/)
//   gfx     the window's GL context and everything drawn into it (gfx/)
//   render  the world's picture: camera, map, soldiers, and the HUD over it (render/)
//
// Each tick: the game's tick on this frame's input, and a snapshot of it. Each frame: a
// RenderState built between the last two snapshots (render/render_state.h), the camera
// following me in it, and the world drawn from it. Everything the client is lives in
// App; nothing else is global.
//
// The client runs from the directory that holds config/, data/ and mods/: the project's
// assets/ in development (xmake run starts it there) and the game's own once shipped, so
// both are found by the same relative paths. data/ is what the game plays by, the same for
// everyone in a game; mods/ what it looks and sounds like, mods/default/ and over it the
// player's pick (mod.h). config/ holds the settings: the defaults are the code's, and
// over them config/client.cfg and server.cfg, which the game writes as it closes, every
// setting with what it is, commented out while it holds its default (config_save, console_save_files).
//
//   client [+data <dir>] [+map <name>] [+<cvar> <value>] [+<command> <args>...]
//
// so `client +map ctf_Ash +r_screenwidth 1920 +r_screenheight 1080`, or `+hud_demo 2`
// for the HUD full of sample data, or `+screenshot out.png` for a PNG of the 60th frame,
// or `+connect localhost` to join a server (net/client_net.c), or `+host` to host one
// here on the sv_* and bots_* cvars and join it, as the menu's Local Play does (after
// the cvars it reads: `+bots_random_noteam 3 +host`). The world stays the local sandbox
// until the server's state comes down the line.
//
// The binds below and input_default_binds's are the game's own, which the player's
// files bind over. V is the radio menu (+radio), opened and shut by a press: a call by its
// number, then a place by its, said to the team from the radio_* cvars. Alt with a
// letter is a taunt (say, say_team). The view's: Escape the menu, Tab the
// weapons, M the teams, F1 the scoreboard, F2 the weapon stats, F3 the minimap
// (ui_minimap), F5 the FPS line (ui_info), F7 the names (ui_playernames). F9 is a window or
// fullscreen (togglewindow), Ctrl+F9 the wireframe (r_wireframe), F10 the debug overlay
// (r_debug), F4 vsync (r_swapeffect, off as the original's default). There is no zoom:
// everyone sees the same 480 units of height.
// A demo playing (net/demo.h): F6 pauses it, F8 runs it fast, as the original's F10 and F8;
// the left and right arrows take it ten seconds back or on.
