// The gostek: layered sprites pinned to the skeleton pose, from GostekGraphics.pas by way
// of soldat-odin's client/render/gostek.odin.
//
// Each part is a quad pinned between two skeleton points: it sits at p1, rotates to face
// p2, and is offset so the sprite's normalized point (cx, cy) lands on p1. Some parts
// stretch along their length (flex), most have a mirrored image for facing left, most
// have a team-2 variant. The table's order is the draw order. The wounds (ranny/)
// follow the part each covers and show as health runs low. The weapons are more
// entries of the same shape.
//
// The colours, the hair, the headgear and the chain come from the soldier's PlayerLook.
// The hairstyles are one list of eight — 1 to 4 the male's, 5 to 6 the waifu's,
// 7 to 8 the new cuts — and the headgear one of three (1-2 the male's, 3 the
// waifu's). They all live in their own shared folders under gostek-gfx, hair/ and
// headgear/, each file named by its style (hair1 to hair8, helm, kap, helm3),
// whichever gostek wears it. The rat and
// the furry wear only army, punk and Mr. T, and no headgear. The chains and the
// dreadlocks hang from the skeleton's points 21 to 24, which the
// simulation swings behind the neck and the head (Soldier.swing, the ragdoll's own
// points on a body) and the snapshot carries in RenderSoldier.swing. The cigar shows
// while one is in the mouth, and the helmet or hat sits in the hand while the brow is
// wiped or it is taken off (the antics).
